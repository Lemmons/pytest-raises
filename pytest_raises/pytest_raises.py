def _pytest_fail_by_mark_or_set_excinfo(item, outcome, marker_name, ExceptionClass, failure_message, traceback):
    """
    Defer a test failure to a later stage, or set ``excinfo`` of ``outcome``, depending
    on ``marker_name``.  This function should only be called for test items that have
    failed -- the end result of calling this function for *any* ``item`` / ``outcome``
    is that the test will fail.

    .. warning::

        **This is a "private" function not intended to be called directly by external projects!**

    Depending on the stage at which this function is called, one of two actions will
    be performed:

    1. ``marker_name='setup_raises'``: a "secret" marker will be added to ``item``
       indicating that the test failed.  This marker is then checked at a later stage
       when it is safe to fail.  See documentation for :func:`_pytest_raises_validation`
       for more information.
    2. ``marker_name='raises'``: the ``outcome.excinfo`` will be populated with an
       exception traceback that will eventually (through ``pytest``) mark the test as
       failed.

    **Parameters**

    ``item``
        The ``pytest`` test item, e.g., what is supplied to
        ``pytest_runtest_setup(item)`` or ``pytest_runtest_call(item)``.

    ``outcome``
        The ``pytest`` test outcome for the ``@pytest.hookimpl(hookwrapper=True)`` hook
        wrappers, where ``outcome = yield``.

    ``marker_name``
        The string marker name.  Values are **assumed** to be ``'setup_raises'`` or
        ``'raises'`` **only**.

        - ``'setup_raises'``: call originates from ``pytest_runtest_setup`` hook wrapper.
        - ``'raises'``: call originates from ``pytest_runtest_call`` hook wrapper.

    ``ExceptionClass``
        The exception class to re-raise.  Expected to be :class:`ExpectedException` or
        :class:`ExpectedMessage`, but not strictly required.

    ``failure_message``
        The string failure message to mark with or re-raise, depending on the value
        of ``marker_name``.

    ``traceback``
        The traceback information if available, ``None`` otherwise.

def _pytest_raises_validation(item, outcome, marker_name):
    """
    Validate that the test ``item`` and corresponding ``outcome`` raised an exception
    of the correct class, and if supplied the exception message was as expected.  A
    given test that has been marked with either ``@pytest.mark.setup_raises`` or
    ``@pytest.mark.raises`` can fail in one of three ways:

    1. The test raised an exception of the correct exception class, but the exception
       message did not match what was specified using either ``message`` or ``match``
       parameters.
    2. The test raised an exception of the incorrect exception class (as specified by
       the ``exception`` argument).
    3. The test was marked with either ``@pytest.mark.setup_raises`` or
       ``@pytest.mark.raises``, but no exception was raised.

    In order to support hook wrappers for both ``pytest_runtest_setup`` and
    ``pytest_runtest_call``, a "handshake" must be performed using a "secret" marker.
    This handshake is only possible because this extension implements a hook wrapper
    for both ``pytest_runtest_setup`` and ``pytest_runtest_call``.  To better explain
    the handshake, we first examine the ``pytest_runtest_call`` hook wrapper.

    ``@pytest.mark.raises(...)`` execution:

        1. The test is run (``outcome = yield``).
        2. This method is called.  If any of the three cases above that indicate failure
           happen, the test is failed.
        3. The test is failed by calling :func:`_pytest_fail_by_mark_or_set_excinfo`,
           which in this case will set ``outcome.excinfo``.
        4. By setting ``outcome.excinfo``, ``pytest`` will take over at a later stage
           and report the test as failed with our message.

    ``@pytest.mark.setup_raises(...)`` execution:

        1. The test *setup* is run (``outcome = yield``).
        2. This method is called, If any of the three cases above that indicate failure
           happen, the test is *marked* for failure.
        3. The test is failed by calling :func:`_pytest_fail_by_mark_or_set_excinfo`,
           which adds a "secret" marker that includes the failure message.
        4. Officially, the entire ``pytest_runtest_setup`` phase is completed without
           any formal failure by this extension.
        5. The ``pytest_runtest_call`` is triggered by ``pytest``, and this method is
           called again.
        6. The "secret" marker is detected, and an explicit invocation of
           ``pytest.fail`` is issued, ultimately failing the test.

    This process is unfortunately a little contrived.  However, it is done this way
    because this extension needs to be able to mark tests as failed, not error.  For
    reasons unknown to the author, any of the following issued during the
    ``pytest_runtest_setup`` hook wrapper will cause the test to **ERROR** rather than
    **FAIL**:

    - Setting ``outcome.excinfo``: during the setup phase this is a write protected
      attribute.
    - Issuing ``pytest.fail(...)``: a call to ``pytest.fail(...)`` during the setup
      phase will trigger a test **error** rather than a failure.

    .. note::

        The use of this handshake has an important implication!  Since the "secret"
        marker must be checked for first in order to fail out early, this means that
        marking a test case with **both** ``@pytest.mark.setup_raises`` and
        ``@pytest.mark.raises`` **cannot** be supported.  In practice, this should not
        be done (it does not make sense, if your setup fails you cannot run the test
        reliably).

    **Parameters**

    ``item``
        The ``pytest`` test item, e.g., what is supplied to
        ``pytest_runtest_setup(item)`` or ``pytest_runtest_call(item)``.

    ``outcome``
        The ``pytest`` test outcome for the ``@pytest.hookimpl(hookwrapper=True)`` hook
        wrappers, where ``outcome = yield``.

    ``marker_name``
        The string marker name.  Values are **assumed** to be ``'setup_raises'`` or
        ``'raises'`` **only**.

        - ``'setup_raises'``: call originates from ``pytest_runtest_setup`` hook wrapper.
        - ``'raises'``: call originates from ``pytest_runtest_call`` hook wrapper.
